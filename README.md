# Python-assignment-2-Maji-Ndogo
This repository contains my solution to the Integrated Project: Understanding Maji Ndogoâ€™s Agriculture, a Python coding challenge from ExploreAI Academy. The assignment applies core Pandas skills to explore, clean, and analyze agricultural data. The goal is to support decision-making around crop selection and land use in Maji Ndogo by examining factors such as rainfall, soil type, and climate. The notebook includes modular functions, test cases, and step-by-step solutions aligned with project guidelines. This work demonstrates my ability to write clean, efficient Python code, perform data wrangling, and extract insights from real-world datasets using data analysis techniques.
